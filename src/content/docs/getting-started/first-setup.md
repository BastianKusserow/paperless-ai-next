title: "First Setup"
---


After starting the container for the first time, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. You'll be greeted by the setup wizard.

Need all available Docker environment variables? See the [Configuration reference](configuration/#docker-environment-variables).

:::caution[Current limitation]
The setup assistant is not yet complete for all configuration paths.
In Docker environments, you should define the key variables directly via `environment:` / `.env` (at minimum `PAPERLESS_API_URL`, `PAPERLESS_API_TOKEN`, `AI_PROVIDER`, and matching provider credentials).

:::note[MFA lockout recovery]
If you later enable MFA and lose access to your authenticator, use the in-container MFA reset CLI.
See [Troubleshooting -> MFA lockout recovery](troubleshooting/#mfa-lockout-recovery).

## Step 1: Create an Admin Account

Choose a username and a secure password. This account is used to log in to Paperless-AI.

---

## Step 2: Connect to Paperless-ngx

You'll need two things from your Paperless-ngx instance:

**API URL** – The address of your Paperless-ngx server, e.g. `http://paperless:8000` or `http://192.168.1.100:8000`. If Paperless-ngx and Paperless-AI next are in the same Docker network, use the service name (e.g. `http://paperless-ngx:8000`).

**API Token** – Found in Paperless-ngx under *Settings → API Tokens*. Create a new token with full permissions.

---

## Step 3: Choose Your AI Provider

Select which AI service should analyze your documents:

| Provider | What you need |
|---|---|
| **OpenAI** | An API key from [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com) |
| **Ollama** | Ollama running locally or on your server |
| **Azure OpenAI** | Azure endpoint + API key + deployment name |
| **Custom / Compatible** | Any OpenAI-compatible API URL + key |

Not sure which to pick? **Ollama** is the privacy-friendly choice (everything runs locally). **OpenAI** is the easiest to get started with.

---

## Step 4: Configure Processing Preferences

- **Which documents to process** – All new documents, or only those with a specific tag
- **What to assign** – Tags, document type, correspondent, language
- **Restrictions** – Should the AI only use tags and correspondents that already exist in Paperless-ngx?

---

## Step 5: Save and Restart

Click **Save**. Then restart the container once to apply the configuration and start the background processing service.

:::caution[Don't skip the restart]
The document processing loop only starts after a clean restart following the initial setup.

## You're Done!

Paperless-AI next will now automatically pick up new documents added to Paperless-ngx, analyze them, and assign metadata. Check the [History](../features/history/) page to see what's been processed.
